# CSCE567 Final Project README

## Project Proposal

All information about project proposal is found their PDF files.

## Summary and Visualizations

In this project, I acquired a data set from 1953 to the present that included information such as incidents, natural disasters, the dates and locations of each incidents.
The way I graphed this information is by using a bar chart to show the number of unique incidents cause by each storm which could be filtered by the year. On top of
this I also included a heat map of the US that could be filtered by the year and disaster while the heat map displayed the number of incidents that have occured 
based upon the filters. The graph could also be modified by the map by selecting a state showing its disasters over time. If no filters are applied, all visuals will 
display data across all times, states, and disaster types.

## Challenges

During the making of the visualizations, I was running into issues trying to link up my previous data set with my current one. However, due to the dataset being 100 times
smaller, inconsistent information and abstract locations, I decided that it was not going to work for my visuals. I needed to display the amount of damages done in USD 
so I decided on making a heat map that shows how consistent certain states have natural disasters occur to show the risk of possibly staying that state. Since I couldn't
find another reliable dataset I figured this was a fitting alternative. Even tried the data from: https://www.emdat.be/ but was getting mix match results that were
also inconsistent.

## Design Decisions

For these visiuals, I wanted to be able to interact with specific elements so that they could see all the information they wanted. On top of this, I wanted to also give
the viewer a general outlook about the natural disasters in the US. This is what lead me to come up with the incidents per year heat map which will show th risk of each 
state. The viewer can use the first map to get specific details about a state's disaster history with the first visual incase they wish to know about specific factors 
such as forrest fires or the disasters that often occur in Florida. Due to the broad spectrum of data that is used here, I want to give the user control of what they 
wish to see. 

Would've liked to a visual that suffered from the most a natural disaster and not just the amount of disasters that have occured. This would show the amount of impact
certain disasters to show how much more certain disasters are compared to others. 

## Discussion of Future Work

I know I've already talked about the damages but I feel as if I could've either found a reliable dataset that recorded the cost in damages of natural disasters or researched every
historical disaster that has hit the US to acquire the damages, this would've helped give audiences a better outlook on natural disasters. I would've like to include 
another heat map showing the damages or even a split graphs that showed damages done by what disaster in a state. I could have also showed a trend line showing how much 
more money disasters cost nowadays vs in the past.
